# Impractial Python Projects

ðŸ“—ðŸ“—ðŸ“—

My solutions to problem sets from Impractical Python Projects: 
[located here](https://nostarch.com/impracticalpythonprojects)

For most I tried starting with only the objective and wrote my code based on that.
Only when I got stuck did I resort to the strategy and pseudocode. 
Occasionally peeking at the solution code when I was really stuck.

Code is structured into chapters. Each file is loosly named as the book's projects are.

I thought this was a really good book to help learn after learning the basics.
